"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone! I always loved the old body style of the iPhone 4 and the size of the newer ones and now I get the best of both worlds, old Body style with a larger screen! I love the way it feels in my hand and I love how crystal clear everything looks. By far my favorite version of the iPhone. Well done Apple!"
"Why is it Locked for cricket carrier?"
"forced to buy cricket carrier with phone??"

 "Not unlocked Cricket carrier? Um, no. Same price unlocked at Apple.
 "It’s the best!I LOVE LOVE LOVE this phone! I always loved the old body style of the iPhone 4 and the size of the newer ones and now I get the best of both worlds, old Body style with a larger screen! I love the way it feels in my hand and I love how crystal clear everything looks. By far my favorite version of the iPhone. Well done Apple!"
 "I’m a cricket customer, how can I buy it without the subscription?I want to buy this phone from you but I already have my family and I using cricket, however, I’m not managing in take of the subscription. I don’t want to have another cricket number if I already have one.
 "This is a Cricket Locked iPhone - It Says So in the Title!"

"I way Forced to Return this supposedly locked to cricket device,This brand New iPhone 12 Pro Mac 512GB SUPPOSEDLY LOCKED TO CRICKET WIRELESS I WAS FORCED TO HAVE TO RETURN THIS DEVICE BACK TO AMAZON 1. THIS DEVICE WOUKD NOT ACTIVATE UNDER THE CRICKET WIRELESS SUBSCRIPTION THAT AMAZON.com HAS SOLD TO ME 2. CRICKEY WIRELESS REFUSED TO PUT CRICKET WIRELESS HAND PROTECTION ON THIS DEVICE DUE TO THEM TELLING ME THAT THIS DEVICE WAS A BYOD DEVICE IN WHICH MEANS THAT THIS DEVICE THAT I WAS FORCED TO RETURN BACK TO AMAZON SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNLOCKED BUT IT WAS NOT UNLOCKED. IT WAS LOCKED TO A MYSTERIOUS CARRIER. THEN I CALLED APPLE INC ABOUT THIS DEVICE AND WITH THEIR WONDERFUL PRIVACY AGREEMENT THAT THEY SO SUBCONSCIOUSLY HAVE WITH ME BUT THEY TOLD ME THAT TODAY DEVICE BELONGED TO SOME INDIVIDUALS NAME AND IT WAS NOT OENED BY AMAZON.com. SO BUYER BEWARE THIS IS IF YOU ARE EVEN TO BE ABLE TO SEE THESE LOCKED DEVICES BY CRICKET WIRELESS"
 Unexpected loss of signal.A lot of iPhone 12 pro users (myself included) are having a problem with the cell service dropping for no reason. My opinion is to delay a purchase until there is a fix for this problem.
 "Getting used to no home button is the only thing taking me awhile to get used to".
"This is the cheapest IPhone i have had by far". "IPhone 12 pro max, brand new and a scratch on the screen. This is the second one. Apple using the cheapest glass and want you to pay top dollar for it. Just goes to show you they don't care at all about customer happiness, just their money.
 "I don’t see what the hype is all about!!!I hate this phone! I last purchased the iPhone 7 Plus. It just feels funny like a slick eel or something. I miss the control button at the bottom compared to the iPhone 7plus. The length and view of the phone was extended but it did nothing for the phone. I don’t see the difference in photos yet either. The color of the phone is not that great either, and unlike in the picture. I am simply not impressed!"
"awesomeness ,came fast and is the best apple so far love the camera"

"Amazing!!!!Got my phone after 3 days when it finally was released and Im very much happy with what i got
 ya entregue el producto yo el viernes entregue el producto espero mi reembolso"

"gracias
 Bought two returned both. If you don’t care about dropped calls go for it!Shame on Apple for releasing before they worked out the bugs. Disgusting. And Tana? Chip? No one seems to bother to even acknowledge a massive returns and compliance worldwide that it drops calls within 30 seconds to 2 minutes and sometimes the speaker works and sometimes it doesn’t. I spent every day for three weeks troubleshooting every possible way and nothing fixed it. Look at the forum read the other reviews again this is everyone all models and worldwide. And now you can’t buy the 11s anymore from Apple because it was the last model?!! Well I found it at Best Buy and you can get AppleCare and the phone is perfect. Apple put me in a really bad situation where I was switching over numbers and had to go back to my back up phone and had no time to even transition the number that I was going to switch from. The whole thing has just been a disaster thank God I returned both of them within the two week period. They finally told me I’m better off returning and not trying to set up a third phone. I think I would’ve lost my mind doing it three times & returning three times! People in line with me we’re taking theirs back but everyone acts like they are surprised when you mention issues. Apple Support will tell you they have no idea what you’re talking about it’s unbelievable! Check Google! Check the Apple forum! Very sorry for those of you who did not! One tec said when the S versions come out about a year later they usually work out the bugs. I am more than annoyed at the time and money I’ve put into this phone. Don’t buy it yet!!!!!!"

Bro Please Make This Phone"
"FullyUnlocked!!!!!! PLEASE!!"

 "Let me listen at my own volume.Apparently Apple gets to decide what I set my volume at. Whenever connected to a Bluetooth device, I get random hearing safety notifications and it turns my volume down.
Apparently Apple gets to decide what I set my volume at. Whenever connected to a Bluetooth device, I get random hearing safety notifications and it turns my volume down.
I purchased this phone with the $55 Cricket monthly plan, it arrived yesterday."

"Cricket did not include instructions in the SIM kit. I called Cricket and was put on hold for a long time until an unhelpful person told me I need to call Amazon if I have questions.
"
"I call Amazon and ask about porting my phone number. Amazon is very friendly but we agree they can't tell me how to port my AT&T number to Cricket. They ask me to call Cricket back."

I call Cricket back and was put on hold for a long time before an unhelpful person told me I need to go to a Cricket store to ask questions or activate the phone."

I call Amazon back to complain about the bait and switch and try to reverse everything. Amazon rep is very friendly and starts a return. I love the iPhone 12 Max Pro and wish I could keep it, but I have to return to Amazon and buy from a different company."

I thought Amazon would protect me from the monstrous practices of Cricket but they don't. Its odd Amazon allows allows Cricket to do this."
 Great deal Love this phone. I made the switch from android mainly due to ecosystem apple has and im not too disappointed."
 They mailed me a piece of plastic! I cannot believe I was sent a literal piece of plastic. The camera lenses were plastic and looked like glass had been replaced with plastic wrap. The phone was completely hollow and did not turn on. The silent button just jiggled around in the slot and I couldn't even plug the phone in or turn it on. It's like they sent me an empty display phone. The box was sealed, quite well I might add. Someone went far to make me think I was getting an iPhone. Hopefully the replacement will be an actual working phone."
 Forced to pay $55/month for the services you don't need This is a wonderfull device and offer from Amazon. however it will be locked to a particular service provider for atleast 6 Months which is not a win for most of the people, If I can get this phone without being carrier locked, will buy in a beat."
 Headphone safety I have a 12 pro. I’ll be listening to music in my car, when the iphone suddenly goes to half volume. A notification will pop up saying something to the effect that Apple wants to protect my hearing. This feature is supposed to be for headphones. I don’t even have the music that loud. I’m still in the return window so i guess i’ll be getting an 11 pro or leaving Apple. This “feature” really sucks. Imagine having m
usic up for a party, when it suddenly, and randomly, cut very low."
 Couldn't use Was excited to use this phone until I realized they didn't include a way to plug it into a wall outlet. It's been sitting in its box next to me for about a week now. Sad"
Pee and poop I farded and shidded lol"
" Asome Nice . Extremely happy with this phone , just the best . Thanks Amazon. For this deal"
	
"The Pros, Cons and Oks for Apple's iPhone 12 Pro (HR).Pros:__________
• I absolutely love the design of this phone. All premium feel that can finally stand up by itself. The curve glass in previous models were impressive but now, with a flat/rounded design, this allows the screen’s borders to be reduced (creating another leap into a future Bezel-less screen)".
• It’s also built very solid. Because of the square design, the grip on this is fantastic. This is the first time since the iPhone 4 I can feel a little more at an ease of not getting a case for it (But still do!..More on this later)".
• The matte back texture leaves no fingerprints whatsoever.
• The biggest selling point for me is the cameras. There are hundreds of reviews on the camera quality and honestly, a picture is worth a thousand words. Let me just say that these cameras excellent (Some info below)".
• Night Mode to me is the biggest gem of this phone. You can be almost in pure darkness and you’ll still be able to get a decent shot. This isn’t just for the back cameras, but the Night Mode works for the front end as well. You know you have a great camera when you no longer see those little exposure pixels when the lighting is poor. Well done Apple. Well done."
• The night mode will also automatically turn on. Didn’t have to do a single thing. I just pointed to an area with little lighting and the phone does the rest.
• Autofocus was spot on in speed and accuracy. Taking group photos, or even me taking a selfie behind a “semi-busy crowd,” it found me without a hitch. You have to thank the lidar scanner because it allows the camera to spot the main person/people very quickly. With my friend’s iPhone 11, we noticed the difference right away when we took a picture with both his and this phone at night. The lidar scanner help grabs the focus of my shots way faster than my friend’s iPhone 11. This also was extremely effective when we were doing some short video shots."
• Deep Fusion for lighting issues, Smart HDR 3 for accurate colors, I feel it’s insane to call it just a camera phone, because it’s a lot more than that".
• The facetime camera also gives an HD image when you see yourself on the screen. It’s nowhere near the cameras in the back, but still very impressive".
• Taking random shots around my neighborhood, I was treated with a solid dynamic range as Dolby Vision HDR delivers the most colorful footage by far on a phone (haven’t tried Google’s Pixels yet)".
• OLED screen panel is finally here and it’s well worth the wait. Took it outside on a clear sunny day and this screen held its ground. The colors pop dramatically and the blacks are solid. Overall an A".
• If you have the previous lighting to USB cables from older iPhones, you can still use them.
• The magnet system isn’t much in use now but the reason why it’s a pro is that this feature is going to open up a whole new market of accessories from third-party companies."
• For the screen size, I was able to reach 80% of the screen by using just one hand. Note: My hands are normal size and if you have small hands then you’re probably only going to be able to reach 40%-60% of the screen with one hand."
• IP68 water resistance, 6 meters (19.7 feet). That is equal to dropping this phone in the low end of a pool and picking it up at the bottom of it. Also, the iPhone 11 was only for 2-meters (6.5 feet)."
• Everything, and I mean everything, opens up in a breeze. I played NBA 2K21 and the graphics are not only top-notch, but surprisingly the phone was not heating up more than the iPhone 11. I played for about 10 minutes and overall the phone was lukewarm at most. The iPhone 11 gives you a hot experience after that time, so a big thumbs up for the 12."
• One great benefit of the 12 Pro is the 6GB of RAM, compared to just 4GB in the regular 12. To be realistic you will not see much of a difference in speed. But over time this extra RAM will come in useful as wear and tear will become a factor for the internal software of these phones."
• Battery life is pretty accurate in what Apple has been stating. I’m getting around a day and a half of use before charging it. I’ll assume that the battery use will increase as I slowly get used to this phone and no longer need to use it as much as I can."
• To save battery power there is a unique software on the phone called Smart Data. FYI. 5G does take a lot of battery power and instead of having it on all time, when you’re not using it, Smart Data can balance the phone in speed and power. If you’re not near a 5G brand, then the phone will go back to 4G, saving battery life for you. You do have the option of overriding this feature and make it only 5G all time but, depending where you live, you’re just killing your battery life without needing to.
• If you’re able to use 5G, you’re in for a treat. 5G is crazy fast compare to the 4G we all use (more on the below)."

"Cons and Oks:__________
• The iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are almost the same in every way. The only thing is the camera setup. With the price bump, you expect maybe a higher refresh rate or more unique software features. If you don’t take pictures with your phone, the 12 Pro isn’t worth it."
• I notice that the magnets are not strong on this phone. There enough to connect to a charger, but it will not hold if the magnets are the only thing holding it up from the ground. Hopefully third party companies will add magnets in their designs for car holders and any other attachments."
• I tried the wallet feature and it’s useless. First, you’re only able to fit a few cards in it. Second, taking it in and out of your pocket, the magnets are not able to hold the wallet. The wallet will either stay in the pocket or come off when putting it away. A serious red flag if you’re out and about."
• The one issue I have with the camera is the limited optical zoom. With all the software features I would expect more where other phones (Note 20) already go up to 5x."
• Decent sound. Loud, not much bass, as expected. They’re enough to watch Netflix on it, but not enough for you to say “wow, the sound is fantastic!”
• No charger in the box. I know Apple has stated it was for environmental issues, but you can’t help and wonder if it was just to cut costs. Either way, not a fan."
• The steel rounded edges are pretty at first, but my fingerprints are now everywhere. I wish they apply the matte finish on these areas. My advice gets a case or skin to cover it."
• As mention before, you need to get a case because the repairs on this phone are ridiculously high. Over $200 to replace the glass. The phone is sturdy but the repair prices are what I’m afraid of."
• The new IPad Airs have the fingerprint scanner on the power button. Still have no idea why Apple doesn’t apply this feature on their phones. The face recognition software still has its limit, and there haven’t been any improvements for the 12 model."
• Elephant in the room, the notch is still there. I would not mind if they kill the face recognition software to have a full screen. I know that’s the reason why we still get the notch."
• Apple screen called “Ceramic Shield” only is effective when you drop your phone. I accidentally put my keys and phone in the same pocket. The result was some super tiny scratches on the screen. Be warned, the “Ceramic Shield” only is effective when you drop your phone."
• I don’t have 5G in my area so the main feature isn’t in use for me. To be honest I think the 5G was a little too early. Apple should have given us a higher refresh rate of 120HZ instead. I understand that having both of them would reduce the battery life greatly, but 5G will not be fully ready to all in a year or two. The iPhone 13 should’ve been the 5G model, and the iPhone 12 should’ve been the 120 HZ screen model. It’s a big letdown since many of you, including me, will not experience this software feature until it comes to our towns/cities."
• FYI: 5G is a battery killer. It may be fast, but it greatly reduces the phone's battery.
• Even the Google Pixel has a 90Hz display, come one Apple. At least bring it in the Pro versions. Sadly here we are."
• Warning: the Apple magnet charger accessory connects to the phone well, but I notice that it’s metal on metal when connecting. Over time I can see a lot of scratches if you’re using the magnet charger. Just another reason to get a case."
• I know 90Hz 120Hz would’ve been great to have, but if you’ve never seen that display before you don’t need to be let down. The OLED on this phone is fantastic. It just stinks for those who know what 90Hz 120Hz looks like, and the 60Hz Apple still has."
• Keep in mind that the Dolby Vision videos you make on this phone will not look nearly as good on screens that are not compatible. The compatible ones are the screens that few have."

"Bottom Line:__________

To be clear, the iPhone 12 will be one of the best phones for 2021. It’s the fast, beautiful OLED screen, and it brings back the iPhone 4, 4s, and 5’s round square design (which is the best design Apple has made). This is a phone that you’re going to have for 3+years, and it will still hold its ground during those future years. I’ve always been a fan of Google’s pixels cameras because of their camera software. But Apple went above and beyond with their cameras, and I felt every shot was worth posting. For newbies to Apple, this is a great phone to get into."

Still, I’m a little upset that the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro are almost the same. With the “Pro” status, you expect a little more than another built-in camera. With the exception of the additional 2 GB of RAM, both phones are the same (this includes the battery). No notch removal, 90 or 120HZ screen, and not even a charger brick. I felt that Apple has more in the tank but wants to wait until the next iPhone to apply the features that we want now."

In the end, if you’re into video making and/or photography get the 12 Pro. Not interested in that stuff, stick to the 12 and save “some” money. The point of Apple products is for consumers to use them in years to come, and this iPhone is no exception. Some of us may still need to wait for 5G in our area, but I believe the iPhone 12 is still a top 3 phone of 2021."

Overall: A beautiful phone with a camera system that shows Apple at its finest".

"Hope I was a help to you.
 BIG DISAPPOINTMENT VERY DISAPPOINTED . My boyfriend bought 2 iPhones 12 pro. One for me one for him, they just arrived last night. I was really excited to get the new phone considering we have been Apple customers for years. When I opened the box I was shocked to see there is NO CHARGER. After we paid $2000, now I have to spend another $100 to buy 2 chargers?!!!! WHAT A SHAME. I am seriously considering returning it and buy a Samsung. The phone still has the sticker on it that’s how big my disappointment was. It’s like buying a refrigerator without the power cord."
WELL DONE APPLE".
"Scam,Is phone is locked And this thing is scam bc you have to stay 6 month on cricket company to make it unlock"
 A perfect phone without needed accessories.Just bought this phone, unlocked. It is an amazing piece of art. Well crafted. Powerful. Feel great in your palm. Top notch cameras. However, spending over a $1000 for a phone that doesn’t comes with a charger or a headphone is rediculous. Apple...don’t be rediculous, making excuses about environmental friendly and blah blah. How do you expect android user that just bought this phone, has a lightning cable lying around on the couch? For that reason, I only give 4 stars; otherwise, a perfect 10 for the phone! Dont waste your money by buying Apple chargers, there are many quality PD charger with lightning cables on Amazon for fraction of the price,l. Watch my quick unboxing video, less than 30s! Heart it if you like. Thanks!"
 Great Phone The gold stainless steel looks very stunning, like a gold bar. Back had a champagne gold finish which, not my favorite, still fits the classiness of the phone. Screen, battery and camera are all a nice upgrade from my iPhone X."

" FAKE!!!!!IPHONE IA FAKE "
 "OMG This is so stupid!"
"locked and full price what a jerks!  broken pretty disappointed this item sucks never turned on"
 "I don't want kraken kraken I need one but not from kraken"

 "Looks premium and modern.The new iPhone 12 Pro's camera works a lot better than the previous generations and it looks a lot more modern and unique."
"WHY! Cricket!This is so ridiculous no one use cricket! This need to be unlocked"
"Adha Nice product that I want to grab "
 "It is locked and stilll Amazon sell it at fulll price"
"Pay full price for a locked phone? Why?Why would someone pay full price $1,054.00 + $55.00 a month for a locked phone? How long will it be locked, forever?"
1. I just want say, if you read the product detail before buying i wouldn't see so many complaints that some iphones come locked. It locked or unlocked the phone quality is the same. Thats why you should pay attention to the product details before you buy."

2. Yes, and I agree with everyone's that its a shame this phone doesn't come with earphones or charger for the price. But if you want to have the latest new phone. The marketing team at Apple knows you will pay whatever price asked."

3. Its also a shame Apple only will provide updates for on 5 years. This i believe is robbery. This means, you have to upgrade your iPhone. This another marketing strategy. Supply & Demand."

So, it up to you to decide to buy or not.

"Locked to a sub-par network Apples latest iPhone is available for purchase on Amazon ONLY "Locked, and to a sub-par network. There is no option to unlock this phone and there is no option for other networks. It’s a big bummer."
